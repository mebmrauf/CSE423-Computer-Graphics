# Vectors and Line Drawing Intro
- Points specify location in space (or in the plane). 
- Vectors have magnitude and direction (like velocity). The difference between two points is a vector. For example, (p,q) - p and q are two points; vector, v = q - p.
- Points ≠ Vectors

### Magnitude of a Vector
<p>|a|= √(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)</p>

### Unit Vector
```
â = a/|a|
```

### Vector Addition
```
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
```

### Vector Subtraction
```
b – a = b + (-a)
a - b ≠ b - a
```

## Dot Product / Scalar Multiplication 
```
a.b = |a||b|Cosθ

|b|^2 = b·b
a.1 = a
a.0 = 0
a.(-1) = -a

if  b and c are two vectors,
Cosθ = bc
if b.c = 0, b and c are perpendiicular
```
```
Properties:
Symmetry: a·b = b·a
Linearity: (a+c)·b = a·b + c·b
Homogeneity: (sa)·b = s(a·b)
```
## Cross Product / Vector Multiplication
```
bxc = |b||c|Sinθâ
```
```
Properties
Antisymmetry: axb = - bΧa
Linearity: (a+c) x b = axb + cxb
Homogeneity: (sa) x b = s(axb)
```
Cross Product

a x b
<p>|i    j    k|</p>
<p>|a<sub>x</sub> a<sub>y</sub> a<sub>z</sub>|</p>
<p>|b<sub>x</sub> b<sub>y</sub> b<sub>z</sub>|</p>

```
Geometric Interpretation of Cross Product
aXb is perpendicular to both a and b 
|aXb| = area of the parallelogram defined by a and b
```
