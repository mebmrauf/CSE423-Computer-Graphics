# Vectors and Line Drawing Intro
- Points specify location in space (or in the plane). 
- Vectors have magnitude and direction (like velocity). The difference between two points is a vector. For example, (p,q) - p and q are two points; vector, v = q - p.
- Points ≠ Vectors

### Magnitude of a Vector
<p>|a|= √(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)</p>

### Unit Vector
```
â = a/|a|
```

### Vector Addition
```
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
```

### Vector Subtraction
```
b – a = b + (-a)
a - b ≠ b - a
```

## Dot Product / Scalar Multiplication 
```
a . b = | a | | b | cos θ

Properties:
Symmetry: a·b = b·a
Linearity: (a+c) ·b = a·b + c·b
Homogeneity: (sa) ·b = s(a·b)
|b|^2 = b·b
a.1 = a
a.0 = 0
a.(-1) = -a
```
